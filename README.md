As at March 2018 there are two schema in use by Funding Options:

* finance_application_v3 - this is the current schema in use by Funding Options for communicating with Partners excepting banks Referring to Funding Options under the Bank Referral Scheme. This references multiple child schema.
* finance_application_v2 - this is in use by the Bank Referral Scheme and was frozen in 2016-08 prior to scheme launch. This references two child schema, sme_v4 and sme_contact_v3.

Please note that use of finance_application_v2 is not supported outside the context of the Bank Referral Scheme - use finance_application_v3 instead.

In order to be compliant with the Government referral scheme as described in the draft Regulations to illustrate the Treasuryâ€™s current intention as to the exercise of powers under clause 5 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill, SME finance applications must contain certain specified information. Therefore, the documents (SME finance applications and accompanying Identifying information) created from the finance_application_v2 schema are required to have the following properties to be complaint with the scheme:

## Versioning
Non-breaking changes will be added to the most recent version of the schema. Breaking changes will require a new version of the schema to be issued. This is explicitly in preference to tagging releases. This versioning system was decided on in order to:
* make this repository accessible to all participants in the Bank Referral Scheme
* make it possible to work with data in multiple formats

## Schema detail
The schema themselves are written in JSON, according to [JSON schema v4](http://json-schema.org/). It is therefore easy to use the schema to construct JSON objects. The schema contain sufficient information to begin designing compatible XML documents (following conversion to Document Type Definitions), CSV files or similar.
